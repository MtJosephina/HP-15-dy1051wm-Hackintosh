 <b>An EFI for HP's 15-dy1051wm that can practically work out of the box with some tweaks. </b>

The only two modifications made to the hardware are: 
Replacing the Intel chip that came with the laptop with a native apple Broadcom chip, and;

Replacing the Intel Octane SSD that came with the laptop as it is not supported in macOS. If you do not do this, you cannot proceed with a hackintosh on this laptop. 

My specifications built for this EFI are as follows:

Intel i1035G1 Ice Lake CPU + GPU
8GB RAM 
256 Sabrient SSD 
BCM94360NG Wireless Card
