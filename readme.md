\f0\b\fs48 \cf0 An EFI for HP\'92s 15-dy1051wm that can practically work out of the box with some tweaks. \
\
\

\f1\b0\fs36 The only two modifications made to the hardware are: \
Replacing the Intel chip that came with the laptop with a native apple Broadcom chip, and;\
\
Replacing the Intel Octane SSD that came with the laptop as it is not supported in macOS. If you do not do this, you cannot proceed with a hackintosh on this laptop. \
\
My specifications built for this EFI are as follows:\
\
Intel i1035G1 Ice Lake CPU + GPU\
8GB RAM \
256 Sabrient SSD \
BCM94360NG Wireless Card\
